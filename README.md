        <h5> I found you when the sea was as calm as a pond,<br>
            I found you when the sky was the perfect shade of blue,<br>
            When I couldn't feel a heart beat inside my chest,<br>
            I found you when I wasn't even looking for you.<br>
            <br><br>
            You are to me as a lighthouse is to a ship,<br>
            It's like my night has finally found day,<br>
            If God gives and takes people for an underlying purpose,<br>
            Then it is my heart's prayer that yours is to stay.<br>
            <br><br>
            You're the most beautiful thing that has happened to me,<br>
            Like the rain that pours down after drought,<br>
            Staying by your side and helping you grow with me<br>
            Is what I want to make my life about.<br>
            <br><br>
            I'm in love with everything about you,<br>
            Your personality, your appearance, your staunch,<br>
            Your serenity when you're deuced,<br>
            Your attentiveness when I faunch.<br>
            <br><br>
            I love you for showing me your love,<br>
            For reassuring me every single day,<br>
            Placing me above everything else,<br>
            Talking even if there's nothing to say.<br>
            <br><br>
            I'll forever spread my arms out for you,<br>
            Till they wither up and fall down.<br>
            I'll swim in whatever pain I have to feel<br>
            Even if it leads me to drown.<br>
            <br><br>
            I want to empty my vessel onto you,<br>
            Give you all the love I possibly can,<br>
            Hold your hand till the end of this world and beyond,<br>
            Make true every bit of our future plan.<br>
            <br><br>
            I'll lay myself down on any track for you,<br>
            All your troubles I'll try to impede,<br>
            Be the woman that you consider me to be,<br>
            The kind of woman that you need.<br>
            <br><br>
            If your love is all but a prison for me,<br>
            Then I desire life sentence with no parole.<br>
            If you still want to know what I feel about you,<br>
            I'll gladly let you take away my soul.</h5>
